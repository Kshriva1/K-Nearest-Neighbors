# K-Nearest-Neighbors

We are given a classified data set from a company! They've hidden the feature column names but have given us the data and the target classes.

We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.

The dataset for this project is [the classified data](https://github.com/Kshriva1/K-Nearest-Neighbors/blob/master/Project%20data)
